        <p>
            Born and raised in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. I am a Developer, Musician, and Martial Artist. 
            I have been studying Music for 8 years, and Martial Arts for 13 years. For the past 2 years I have studied computer programming and web development. 
            I have always had an affinity to working with computers since I was young, and I naturally started to learn about hardware and software. 
            <br>
            My thing I enjoy most about Web Development is it is always growing and it encourages constant learning. 
            In this itâ€™s much like martial arts. We adapt to changes in our environment. Only in adversity do we grow. 
            My goal is to become a great developer who can grow and learn.
